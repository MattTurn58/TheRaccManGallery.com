          ​The time it takes to finish your commission varies 1 week - 3 months

          If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have
          previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount
          of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make and is
          usually based on an hourly wage.
